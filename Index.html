      <h2>Understanding Poverty</h2>
       <img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2022/06/poverty-india-1.jpg" alt="understanding ">
      <p>Understanding Poverty involves exploring the complex and multifaceted challenges faced by individuals and communities around the world. Poverty goes beyond a lack of money or resources; it encompasses a deprivation of basic human needs and opportunities, limiting individuals' ability to lead fulfilling lives.
      
      Key Dimensions of Poverty
Income Poverty:

Defined as earning below the minimum income level required to meet basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing.
The World Bank identifies extreme poverty as living on less than $2.15 per day (as of 2022).
Multidimensional Poverty:

Captures other forms of deprivation, such as lack of access to education, healthcare, clean water, and sanitation.
It recognizes that poverty is not only about income but also about living conditions and well-being.
Causes of Poverty
Economic Factors:

Unemployment: A lack of job opportunities leaves people without a steady income.
Economic Inequality: Disparities in wealth distribution can create systemic poverty.
Social and Political Factors:

Lack of Education: Limited access to quality education reduces employment opportunities.
Discrimination and Marginalization: Certain groups face systemic barriers to social and economic participation.
Environmental Factors:

Climate Change: Disasters like droughts, floods, and hurricanes disproportionately affect the poorest communities.
Resource Scarcity: Depletion of natural resources, such as clean water and fertile land, exacerbates poverty.
Conflict and Instability:

Wars, political instability, and forced displacement uproot individuals and disrupt economies.
Effects of Poverty
Health:

Limited access to healthcare increases vulnerability to diseases and reduces life expectancy.
Malnutrition is common, particularly among children in poverty-stricken areas.
Education:

Poverty restricts access to education, perpetuating a cycle of deprivation.
Children from poor families are more likely to drop out of school to support their households.
Social and Psychological Impact:

Poverty can lead to feelings of hopelessness, stress, and social exclusion.
It often perpetuates generational cycles, trapping families in long-term poverty.

      <h2>Global Poverty Statistics</h2>

       <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/eb/f2/a4ebf2aecf466549387d7453d79c3001.jpg" alt="statistics ">
      <p>
Extreme Poverty:

700 million people (approximately 9% of the global population) live on less than $2.15 per day, the World Bank's threshold for extreme poverty (2022).
Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for about 60% of the global extreme poor, despite having only 14% of the world's population.
Children and Poverty:

1 in 5 children globally lives in extreme poverty.
Poverty is the leading cause of child mortality, with an estimated 15,000 children under age 5 dying daily from preventable causes such as malnutrition, lack of access to clean water, and inadequate healthcare.
Education and Poverty:

Around 244 million children and youth worldwide are out of school, many due to poverty.
Children in low-income countries are 4 times more likely to be out of school compared to those in wealthier nations.
Health and Poverty:

Nearly 2 billion people lack access to essential medicines, many of whom live in poverty-stricken areas.
Poor nutrition, a hallmark of poverty, contributes to 45% of deaths in children under 5.
Access to Basic Needs:

771 million people lack access to safe drinking water.
1.7 billion people do not have basic sanitation facilities.
Around 2.4 billion people rely on unsafe or inefficient cooking methods, exposing them to health risks.
Gender and Poverty:

Women are more likely to experience poverty due to systemic gender inequalities.
For every 100 men aged 25–34 living in extreme poverty, there are 122 women in the same age group.
Regional Inequalities:

Sub-Saharan Africa:

Hosts the highest proportion of people living in extreme poverty (about 40% of its population).
The region has the world's lowest average life expectancy at 63 years.
South Asia:

Home to the second-largest population of people in poverty, with about 30% of the global total.
Significant progress has been made, but disparities persist.
Economic Impact of Poverty:

Poverty costs the global economy an estimated $1.5 trillion annually due to lost productivity and reduced economic potential.
Developing nations lose about 10% of GDP yearly due to the effects of extreme poverty.
Progress in Poverty Reduction:

The global extreme poverty rate has declined significantly, from 36% in 1990 to 9% in 2022. However, progress has slowed in recent years due to:
COVID-19 pandemic: Pushed an additional 97 million people into poverty in 2020 alone.
Climate change: 

Expected to push an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030 if unaddressed.</p>
